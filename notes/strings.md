- strings
  - nothing but a sequence of bytes
  - if you concaentate a byte `0`, it will display a binary, since string is not valid anymore
    - `<<bytes>>`
  - closed with double quotes
- charlists
  - closed with single quotes
  - each value in a charlist is the Unicode code point of a character whereas in a binary, the codepoints are encoded as UTF-8
- stick to strings, charlists are mainly supported because they are required for some Erlang modules
- string functions
  - `length/1`
  - `replace/3`
  - `duplicate/2`
  - `split/2`
  - `graphemes/1`
    - separates characters into list (graphemes)
  - `is_binary/1` - check if parameter is a string
    - use `when` syntax
